PhD Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering

Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa  


## 🧑‍💻 About Me 
I am a PhD candidate working on artificial intelligence for healthcare. 
My research explores multimodal representation learning, combining structured data, clinical text, and medical imaging to create unified patient embeddings. 
I am particularly interested in how these techniques can improve patient similarity search and predictive modeling, ultimately supporting better clinical decision-making in hospital care.
